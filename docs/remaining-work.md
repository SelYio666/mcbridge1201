# Remaining work / client boundary

This file records what is intentionally not verified in the current environment. It is not a
claim that these paths work.

## Blocked: client GUI / network / multiplayer

A PCL-based Fabric 1.21.1 client joins a singleplayer world, renders terrain/HUD, and shows the
inventory with TrashSlot's trash button. Item transfer, persistence, ironchests GUI and sync are
still **not verified**:

- trashslot client GUI, `ClientPlayNetworking` receiver, actual packet delivery;
- lithium gameplay/rendering;
- two-client synchronization;
- ironchests GUI/render.

To close these, provide a Fabric 1.21.1 client instance with:

- the same Fabric loader/API versions as the server profiles;
- the patched mods and native Balm 21;
- a display/GPU (or a supported software GL stack);
- a way to capture a screenshot and drive the client (key/mouse or a test client harness).

Acceptance would be: open the trash GUI, move a stack to/from the trash slot, restart, reopen;
and a two-client sync check. Do not mark the profiles as client-compatible without that.

## Optional, not blocking the above

- **Chunk optimization**: the P13 port delegates to vanilla `method_14134`; the old lithium
  multi-entry cache/off-thread fast path is not reimplemented. It is a performance loss, not a
  correctness gap.
- **Nested mixins**: now expanded (P48); `@At` ordinal is extracted but not validated against the
  target method, and slice/local capture remain unparsed.
- **Forge member-level analysis**: out of the current Fabric 1.21.1 target; would need an SRG /
  NeoForge index and a separate loader target.
- **Client-only samples** (`appleskin`, `modmenu`): they cannot be meaningfully booted on a
  dedicated server; no new profile is claimed.
